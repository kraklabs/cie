## Dual Licensing Model

CIE follows a **dual licensing model**, similar to:
- MySQL
- Qt Framework
- Sentry
- MongoDB (historically)

This means:
1. The **same codebase** is available under both licenses
2. You choose which license fits your needs
3. Open source projects benefit from AGPL's community-driven development
4. Commercial users get flexibility without copyleft obligations

## Why AGPL v3 for Open Source?

We chose AGPL v3 to:
- Ensure improvements benefit the entire community
- Prevent "cloud provider lock-in" where companies profit without contributing
- Maintain a vibrant, collaborative open source ecosystem
- Give back to the community that builds CIE

## Why Offer Commercial Licensing?

We offer commercial licensing to:
- Support development of CIE through sustainable funding
- Enable enterprise adoption without legal concerns
- Provide priority support and guarantees for mission-critical deployments
- Allow proprietary use cases that benefit from CIE's capabilities
